The person_generator_GND.py script generates persons from GND, based on their country wich is set to Israel. The occupation of the persons are also extracted. This script generates the output file called generated_persons_GND.ttl
which is stored in output folder. 

The person_generator_GND_Occontology.py script, mappes the occupations URIs in the generated file to JudaicaLink occupation ontology which is generated as explained in ontology folder. This script generates the output file called
generated_persons_GND_Occontology.ttl which is stored in output folder. This is the fnal version of the dataset used in JudaicaLink. 

In this script, the GND dump which is already loaded on our fuskei triple store, is accessed through connecting to the sparql endpoint.
