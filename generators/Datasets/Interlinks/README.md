# JudaicaLink dataset interlinks 

#### Generated by: Maral Dadvar


First all the datasets which already exist on JudaicaLink where loaded on my local Fuseki.
Then using manual queries on Furseki all the common links between the datasets were identified and added to the the
datasets as a owl:sameAs.

The interlinks-02.ttl file is generated using the JudaicaLink-interlink-01.py script. This contains all the sameAs links
of the JudaicaLink datasets which are interlinked. So the interlinks will not be directly added to the JudaicaLink 
datasets, but as a separate file (the interlinks-02.ttl file) which only contains the interlinks. 

The script JudaicaLink-interlink-02 has created the interlinks-03.ttl file. In this file the freimann-gnd entries are also added to the interlinks
among all the judaicaLink datasets. 

The script JudaicaLink-interlink-03 has created the interlinks-04.ttl file. In this file all the interlinked entities are made
both ways. i.e. if A owl:saemAs B ==> B owl:sameAs A 

The script JudaicaLink-interlink-04 has created the files interlinks-04-enriched-01.ttl , 02, ..., 07. This script has added all the other sameAs
values to each triple in the original file from the different datasets.  

All the scripts are in the 'scripts' folder and all the generated files are in the 'output' folder.
