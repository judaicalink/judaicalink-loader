# Generated persons from DBPedia

#### Generated by: Maral Dadvar


The person_generator_DBPedia.py script generates persons from DBPedia based on their occupation. 
To do so, first the occupation URIs are read from the occ_ontology.rdf file in sources folder. Then using that URI we query DBPedia data dump by accessing the DBPedia sparql end point (http://dbpedia.org/sparql) 
to extract the persons from that occupation category. For every person all the labels and sameAs links to other sources are extracted. The occupation of every person is mapped to Judaicalink occupation ontology 
as discribed in ontology folder.
The output RDF file, generated_person_dbpedia.ttl,  is stored in output folder in Turtle format. 

For the generated persons who also had a link to Wikidata, we generated their gndid, by extrating the id from Wikidata when availabe. To do so we used the gndid_generator.py script.
The script would pars the generated_person_dbpedia.ttl file, and extract the wikidata URIs and then by accessing wikidara sparql endpoint (https://query.wikidata.org/sparql) , would extract the corresponding gndid
of that person. 
The RDF output file, generated_gndid.ttl, is stored in output folder in Turtle format.
