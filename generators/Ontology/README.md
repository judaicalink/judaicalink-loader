# JudaicaLink ontology 

#### Generated by: Maral Dadvar


The classes and properties used in JudaicaLink ontology are created on the fly based on the information that we encounter and need to be represented. However, we are consistent on the usage of the properties and the coined URI’s are stable and unique. 

The attached table illustrates the current state of the JudaicaLink ontology. 
When a piece of information described in an encyclopedia is extracted, we assign the class ‘Concept’.  We use Natural Language Analysis techniques in order to analysis the concepts to identify whether they are a person. When identified as such, the class ‘Person’ is assigned to them and further properties are added. 
The information extracted from the larger databases, for now are about personas, therefore the class ‘Person’ are assigned to them. The class ‘Documentation’ describes the metadata of the encyclopedias’ crawling process.
